        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><br>I am currently an aspiring software engineer, working on personal projects to<br><br>
            keep my skills sharp, build up my portfolio, and to keep up with modern practices.<br><br>
            I was educated at Kent State University and graduated cum laude in May 2023 with a<br><br>
            B.S. in computer science with a concentration in data engineering.  I am hoping to<br><br>
            land a job in the area of software or data engineering at a company where I can grow<br><br>
            my skills and career in a professional environment.  My portfolio includes games such as<br><br>
            Left, Right, Center and Snake, a website for Kent State University's Fencing Club, and more.<br><br>
            Please feel free to take a look at all my projects, developed both individually and in scrum teams<br><br>
            using agile methodologies within the software development life cycle.  Feel free<br><br>
            to go to the <a href="contact.html">CONTACT</a> page if you want to reach out to me, or go to my<br><br>
            <a href="https://github.com/SeaPat22">GitHub</a> account to see the code for all my projects.</p>
